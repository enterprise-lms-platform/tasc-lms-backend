## MEDIUM — Incomplete Serializers & Models

### 1. AssignmentCreateUpdateSerializer — Missing `update()` Method

**File:** `apps/catalogue/serializers.py`

**Status:** Has `create()` and `validate()` but no `update()` method. PUT/PATCH on assignments won't work correctly without it.

**Fix:** Add `update()` to handle fields like `instructions`, `max_points`, `due_date`, `rubric_criteria`, `allowed_file_types`, etc.

---

### 2. Quiz Model — Missing Fields

**File:** `apps/catalogue/models.py`

**Current Quiz model** has: `session` (OneToOne), `settings` (JSONField), timestamps. Quiz settings are stored in the `settings` JSON field.

**What's still missing:**
- `QuizQuestion` is missing:
  - `explanation` (TextField, blank=True) — text shown after answering, explaining the correct answer
- Consider promoting frequently-queried settings from JSON to model fields for DB-level filtering:
  - `time_limit_minutes` (PositiveIntegerField, null=True)
  - `randomize_questions` (BooleanField, default=False)

**Severity:** MEDIUM for `explanation` field, LOW for promoting JSON fields.

---

### 3. Assignment Model — Minor Gap

**File:** `apps/catalogue/models.py`

**Only missing:**
- `file_upload_required` (BooleanField, default=True) — frontend infers this from `allowed_file_types` being non-empty, but an explicit flag would be cleaner.

**Severity:** LOW.

---

## MEDIUM — Incomplete Views & Actions

### 4. DiscussionViewSet — Moderation

**File:** `apps/learning/views.py`

**What works:** Full CRUD + replies. The `Discussion` model already has `is_pinned`, `is_locked`, `is_deleted` boolean fields.

**What's missing — add these as `@action` endpoints:**

**a) Pin/unpin:**
```
POST /api/v1/learning/discussions/{id}/pin/
```
Response: `{ "is_pinned": true }` — toggles pin state. Instructor/manager only.

**b) Lock/unlock:**
```
POST /api/v1/learning/discussions/{id}/lock/
```
Response: `{ "is_locked": true }` — toggles lock state. When locked, no new replies allowed. Instructor/manager only.

**c) Filter by course/session** — add query params to list action:
```
GET /api/v1/learning/discussions/?course=5&session=12&search=networking
```
Currently only basic queryset. Add `course`, `session`, and `search` (title/content) filters.

---

### 5. ModuleViewSet — Bulk Reorder

**File:** `apps/catalogue/views.py`

Currently, reordering requires individual PATCH requests per module. Add a bulk endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/catalogue/modules/reorder/
```
Request:
```json
{
  "course": 5,
  "order": [
    { "id": 10, "order": 0 },
    { "id": 11, "order": 1 },
    { "id": 12, "order": 2 }
  ]
}
```
Response: `{ "updated": 3 }`

Use `transaction.atomic()` and `bulk_update()` for efficiency.

---

### 6. SessionViewSet — Gaps

**File:** `apps/catalogue/views.py`

**a) Quiz creation via API:**
Currently `/sessions/{id}/quiz/` only supports GET and PATCH. Add POST to create a new Quiz for a session:
```
POST /api/v1/catalogue/sessions/{id}/quiz/
```
Request:
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "time_limit_minutes": 30,
    "passing_score_percent": 70,
    "max_attempts": 3,
    "shuffle_questions": true
  }
}
```
Response: `QuizDetailResponse` (session + settings + empty questions array)

**b) Assignment creation via API:**
Same pattern — add POST to `/sessions/{id}/assignment/`:
```
POST /api/v1/catalogue/sessions/{id}/assignment/
```
Request:
```json
{
  "assignment_type": "project",
  "instructions": "Build a REST API...",
  "max_points": 100,
  "due_date": "2026-04-01T23:59:00Z",
  "allowed_file_types": [".pdf", ".zip", ".py"],
  "max_file_size_mb": 50
}
```

**c) Session preview for non-enrolled users:** Add a `preview` action returning limited session data (title, description, duration) without content URLs.

---

### 7. SubmissionViewSet — Remaining Enhancements

**File:** `apps/learning/views.py`

Bulk grade and statistics actions are now implemented. Still missing:

**a) File upload validation:** In `create()`, check `submitted_file_name` extension against `Assignment.allowed_file_types` and file size against `Assignment.max_file_size_mb`.

**b) Resubmission tracking:** Currently allows only one submission per enrollment+assignment. Add `attempt_number` field and allow multiple submissions up to `Assignment.max_attempts`.

---

## LOW — Remaining Services & Templates

### 8. Email Templates

**File:** `config/settings.py`

**Current:** Console backend in dev, SendGrid configured for prod. `templates/emails/` directory does not exist.

**Templates to create:**

| Template | Trigger | Key variables |
|---|---|---|
| `verification.html` | User registration | `user_name`, `verification_url` |
| `password_reset.html` | Password reset request | `user_name`, `reset_url`, `expiry_hours` |
| `enrollment_confirmation.html` | Successful enrollment | `user_name`, `course_title`, `start_date` |
| `certificate_issued.html` | Course completion | `user_name`, `course_title`, `certificate_url` |
| `payment_receipt.html` | Successful payment | `user_name`, `course_title`, `amount`, `currency`, `transaction_id`, `date` |

---

### 9. Notifications ViewSet — Missing Features

**File:** `apps/notifications/views.py`

**Works:** CRUD + `mark_read` + `mark_all_read` + `unread_count` + type filter + is_read filter

**Missing:**
- Date range filter: `?created_after=2026-03-01&created_before=2026-03-17`
- Bulk delete: `POST /notifications/bulk_delete/` with `{ "ids": [1, 2, 3] }`
- Notification preferences: `GET/PUT /notifications/preferences/` → `{ "email_enabled": true, "push_enabled": false, "types": { "enrollment": true, "system": true, "milestone": false } }`

---

## LOW — Silent Exception Handling & Code Quality

### 10. Payment Webhook Handlers — Silent `pass`
- **File:** `apps/payments/utils/webhook_handlers.py` (lines 271, 317)
- **Problem:** `_handle_failed_payment()` and `_handle_refund()` silently ignore `Payment.DoesNotExist`.
- **Fix:** Replace `pass` with `logger.warning(f"Payment not found for transaction {transaction_id}")`.

### 11. Payment Validators — Silent Validation
- **File:** `apps/payments/utils/payment_validators.py` (line 328)
- **Problem:** Invalid phone number silently swallowed.
- **Fix:** Add `logger.info(f"Phone validation skipped for {phone}: {e}")`.

### 12. Calendar Service — Timezone Silencing
- **File:** `apps/livestream/services/calendar_service.py` (line 57)
- **Problem:** `except Exception: pass` on invalid timezone — events may use wrong timezone silently.
- **Fix:** `logger.warning(f"Invalid timezone {tz}, falling back to UTC")` then set `tz = 'UTC'`.

### 13. Audit Views — Date Parsing
- **File:** `apps/audit/views.py` (lines 79, 89)
- **Problem:** Malformed date filters silently ignored — user gets unfiltered results without knowing.
- **Fix:** Return `400 Bad Request` with message: `"Invalid date format for 'date_from'. Expected YYYY-MM-DD."`.

### 14. Catalogue Views — Category Filter
- **File:** `apps/catalogue/views.py` (line 118)
- **Problem:** Non-numeric category ID silently ignored.
- **Fix:** Return `400` or log warning and skip filter.

### 15. Livestream Webhook Health Check — Misnamed
- **File:** `apps/livestream/views.py`
- **Problem:** `validate_webhook` action returns `{"status": "ok"}` without doing any validation.
- **Fix:** Either rename to `webhook_health` or implement actual webhook signature validation for the configured platform.

### 16. StorageQuotaView — Silent S3 Failures
- **File:** `apps/common/views.py` (lines 362-366)
- **Problem:** Two bare `except Exception: pass` blocks when calculating storage usage from S3. If S3 is misconfigured or down, the endpoint silently returns `used_bytes: 0` with no indication of failure.
- **Fix:** Log warnings and optionally return a `storage_error` flag in the response so the frontend can show "unable to calculate" instead of misleading "0 bytes used".

## PERFORMANCE — N+1 Query Risks

### 17. ViewSets Missing `select_related`/`prefetch_related`
Several viewsets query models with foreign keys but don't optimize their querysets:
- **`EnrollmentViewSet`** (`apps/learning/views.py`) — `Enrollment` has FK to `user` and `course`, but `get_queryset()` does plain `Enrollment.objects.filter(user=...)` with no `select_related`
- **`DiscussionViewSet`** (`apps/learning/views.py`) — `Discussion` has FK to `user`, `course`, `session` — no `select_related`
- **`DiscussionReplyViewSet`** (`apps/learning/views.py`) — `DiscussionReply` has FK to `user`, `discussion` — no `select_related`
- **`SubmissionViewSet`** (`apps/learning/views.py`) — `Submission` has FK to `enrollment`, `assignment` — no `select_related`
- **`NotificationViewSet`** (`apps/notifications/views.py`) — no `select_related` at all
- **`InvoiceViewSet`** / **`TransactionViewSet`** (`apps/payments/views.py`) — no `select_related` despite FK to `user`
- **Fix:** Add `.select_related()` for FK fields accessed in serializers and `.prefetch_related()` for reverse relations. This prevents N+1 queries on list endpoints that could degrade performance at scale.

---

## Django Admin Gaps

### 16. Catalogue Admin — Missing Model Registrations
- **File:** `apps/catalogue/admin.py`
- **Registered:** `QuestionCategory`, `BankQuestion`, `Assignment`, `Quiz`, `QuizQuestion`, `Module`
- **NOT registered:** `Course`, `Session`, `Category`, `Tag`
- **Fix:** Add `@admin.register(Course)`, etc. with appropriate `list_display`, `list_filter`, `search_fields`.

### 17. Livestream Admin — No admin.py
- `apps/livestream/admin.py` does not exist.
- **Create it** and register: `LivestreamSession`, `LivestreamAttendance`, `LivestreamRecording`, `LivestreamQuestion`
- Example:
```python
@admin.register(LivestreamSession)
class LivestreamSessionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('id', 'title', 'platform', 'status', 'scheduled_start', 'created_at')
    list_filter = ('platform', 'status')
    search_fields = ('title',)
```

## TEST COVERAGE GAPS

| App | Current Tests | Major Gaps |
|---|---|---|
| `learning` | 27 tests | Quiz submission tests missing, report generation not tested |
| `catalogue` | 95 tests | Quiz creation/update minimal, assignment tests basic, course review tests missing |
| `payments` | 8 tests | Webhook handlers not tested |
| `accounts` | 48 tests | CSV bulk import not tested (now implemented — needs tests) |
| `audit` | 6 tests | Minimal |
| `notifications` | 2 tests | Only email provider routing tested; CRUD and mark_read not tested |
| `livestream` | **0 tests** | **No test file exists** — create `apps/livestream/tests.py` |

**Priority:** Create `apps/livestream/tests.py` with tests for:
- Session CRUD (create, update status, start/end)
- Attendance tracking (mark joined, mark left, duration calculation)
- Zoom webhook handler (mock webhook payloads for each event type)
- LivestreamQuestion CRUD and answer flow
